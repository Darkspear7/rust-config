A soon-to-be Rust library to read and parse configuration files.

The idea is to make it very similar to [libconfig](http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig/).

Still a lot of work to do; I just started the project. I will update docs, README, and tests
soon. **I do not recommend using any of this yet - it needs a bit more work**.
